                    Experience the best things in life with a clear mind and healthy
                    body. <br />
                    Whether you are trying yoga for the first time, returning from a
                    long break, or already enjoying the benefits of the practice, we
                    have a sequence made just for you! <br />
                    <br />
                    In case you are wondering why our prices are so low, here’s the
                    reason: <br />
                    Everyone could enjoy a richer life by continuously practicing
                    awareness of their bodies. When we step onto our mats, we are
                    setting intentions for ourselves – to maintain the proper function
                    of our bodies, prevent back injuries, avoid joint deterioration,
                    boost our mood, and gain mental focus. Yoga helps you achieve all
                    these, but many people hesitate to practice it consistently because
                    of the high costs and studio memberships associated with it. To
                    encourage you to take control of your well-being, we make our
                    classes affordable and even offer class packages to save you more
                    money! <br />
                    <br />
                    There is a beautiful world out there waiting for you to explore it,
                    why not experience every step of the journey as your best self?

                <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>
                  "Physical activity," "exercise," and "physical fitness" are terms
                  that describe different concepts. However, they are often confused
                  with one another, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
                  This paper proposes definitions to distinguish them. Physical
                  activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal
                  muscles that results in energy expenditure. The energy expenditure
                  can be measured in kilocalories. Physical activity in daily life can
                  be categorized into occupational, sports, conditioning, household,
                  or other activities. Exercise is a subset of physical activity that
                  is planned, structured, and repetitive and has as a final or an
                  intermediate objective the improvement or maintenance of physical
                  fitness. Physical fitness is a set of attributes that are either
                  health- or skill-related. The degree to which people have these
                  attributes can be measured with specific tests. These definitions
                  are offered as an interpretational framework for comparing studies
                  that relate physical activity, exercise, and physical fitness to
                  health.
